# DeepFake Video Detection

This project named as DeepFake Video Detection,used to detect any video is deepfake or not, is a web app whose backend host a pre trained model  and runs in flask. You can run this project on your local machine as well as on cloud very easily.



# Environment Setup

Make sure Anaconda is installed and launch anaconda prompt and navigate to root directory in the anaconda prompt

create venv

```shell
conda create -n deepfakedetection python=3.10
```

Activate

```shell
conda activate deepfakedetection 
```

In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

run the app.py file 

```shell
python app.py
```

Once you see this url - http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in logs, open it in browser.

Now your setup is ready.

# DeepFakeVideoDetector
DeepFake Video Detector is a Flask-based web application that identifies whether a given video has been tampered with using face-swap deepfake techniques. It leverages a trained GRU-based neural network model to analyze sequences of frames and predict authenticity. 
# 🎭 DeepFake Video Detection

**DeepFake Video Detection** is a Flask-based web application that detects whether a video is real or deepfake using a pre-trained GRU-based neural network. The app is lightweight, user-friendly, and supports both local and cloud-based deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload any video and detect if it’s deepfake
- Pre-trained GRU model for binary classification (Real/Fake)
- Simple and interactive web interface
- Real-time prediction with confidence output
- Works fully offline once set up locally
