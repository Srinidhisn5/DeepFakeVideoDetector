# DeepFakeVideoDetector
DeepFake Video Detector is a Flask-based web application that identifies whether a given video has been tampered with using face-swap deepfake techniques. It leverages a trained GRU-based neural network model to analyze sequences of frames and predict authenticity. 
# üé≠ DeepFake Video Detection

**DeepFake Video Detection** is a Flask-based web application that detects whether a video is real or deepfake using a pre-trained GRU-based neural network. The app is lightweight, user-friendly, and supports both local and cloud-based deployment.
